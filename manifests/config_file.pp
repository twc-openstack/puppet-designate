# == Define: designate::config_file
#
# Manage permissions for configuration files, and optionally create them if
# needed.  It also has the ability to automatically create symlinks to the
# managed config files from a virtualenv's directory.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*file*]
#  (optional) The name of the file to manage.  The directory should not be
#  specified, since it will be assumed to be relative to /etc/designate.
#
# [*ensure*]
#  (optional) This is passed through to the file resource for the config file.
#  It can be undef, present, or absent.  Defaults to undef
#
# [*source_dir*]
#  (optional) Directory to copy config files from.  This should be a URL they
#  can be handled by Puppet's file resource.  It will attempt to append $file
#  and $file.sample to this path to find the file to copy.  One use for this is
#  to copy example config files from virtualenv git repos, but it can be used
#  to copy config files from anywhere.  Defaults to undef.
#
# [*link_from_dir*]
#  (optional) If specified, then link the config file given into the directory
#  given.  This is used to link the config files in /etc/designate into a
#  virtualenv environment.  Defines to undef.
#
# [*replace*]
#  (optional) If true, then files in source_dir will replace any config files
#  in /etc/designate when they change.  If false, then existing files will be
#  unmodified.  Defaults to false.
